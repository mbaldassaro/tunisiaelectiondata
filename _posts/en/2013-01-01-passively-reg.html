    description: "This CSV contains the number of passively registered voters who cast ballots and the total number of passively registered voters per electoral district. It was originally obtained from the National Constituent Assembly Report on the Elections (PDF), published by the Independent High Commission for Elections in February 2012 and converted to CSV by  <a href='https://github.com/fwelections/tunisia-election-data'>OpenGovTN</a>."
description: "<p>A passively registered voter is a citizen enjoying the right to vote in accordance with the provisions of the electoral law of the country, and who is automatically registered in the list of voters, generally on the basis of reliable information available to the local authorities. In the 2011 National Constituent Assembly elections, the National ID database was used to identify eligible voters. Eligible voters were encouraged to actively register by confirming their voter registration data at a designated voter registration center.
According to statistics published by the ISIE on November 12, 2011, 3,870,322 voters â€“ 49% of  7,993,924 eligible voters according to the National ID database - did not actively register and therefore were considered as passively registered voters.  Only 14% of passively registered voters cast ballots during the October 23, 2011 NCA elections. This visualization shows the passively registered voter turnout by district in the 2011 NCA elections.</p>"

<p>Tunisia is made up of 24 governorates, which are subdivided into 264 delegations. This map visualizes the disparity between actively registered voters and eligible voters by delegation. Actively registered voters meet the age and citizenship requirements for voting and have registered to vote. Eligible voters meet the requirements to vote, but have not actively registered to vote. </p>

Make sure you have read the [documentation regarding installing and setting up a PostGIS-enabled database](!SITE.GITHUB!/blob/gh-pages/setup.md#data-management-and-maps).

### Importing data to PostGIS

This map is comprised of two datasets - [district shapefiles](https://github.com/fwelections/tunisia-election-data/tree/master/shapes) and tabular [eligibility + registration data](https://github.com/fwelections/tunisia-election-data/blob/master/2011data/misc/Turnout.csv). To import the shapefiles see the [setup.md for instructions on importing geographic data](!SITE.GITHUB!/blob/gh-pages/setup.md#importing-geographic-data-to-postgis).


You're now ready to style your map in TileMill. Create a new project. In TileMill create a PostGIS layer following the [online documentation](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/postgis-work/), specifying the `eligibility` table.

Paste in the appropriate html for the and [tooltip](!SITE.GITHUB!/blob/gh-pages/map-src/tooltip-src.html) (labeled 'eligibility')  See the [Eligibility TileMill project](!SITE.GITHUB!/tree/gh-pages/map-src/eligibility) for CartoCss styles.
